# External Files

This directory manages references to external audio, video, and large binary files stored outside the Git repository.

## File Types

- **Audio Files**: Podcasts, lectures, TTS-generated content
- **Video Files**: Educational videos, recorded sessions
- **Large Documents**: PDFs, presentations, research papers
- **Binary Assets**: Images, diagrams, interactive content

## Storage Strategy

Files are stored externally (OneDrive, Google Drive, etc.) with references maintained here.

## File Naming Convention

- `{subject}-{topic}-audio-refs.md`
- `{subject}-{topic}-video-refs.md`
- `{subject}-{topic}-documents.md`

*External file references will be added as multimedia content is integrated.*
