## Subject Structure

Each subject directory contains its own complete learning environment:

```
{subject-name}/
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.md                 # Subject configuration and goals
â”œâ”€â”€ scope-definition.md         # Learning boundaries and focus areas
â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge-baseline.md       # Initial knowledge assessment
â”œâ”€â”€ learning-objectives.md      # Structured learning goals
â”œâ”€â”€ initial-concepts.md         # Concept hierarchy and dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ content/                    # Subject-specific learning materials
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ session-*.md            # Learning sessions and tutorials
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ explanations/           # Detailed concept explanations
â”œâ”€â”€ assessments/                # Subject-specific tests and evaluations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ baseline-test.md        # Initial knowledge test

This structure ensures each subject is self-contained while maintaining consistency across all learning domains.

## Adding New Subjects

To add a new learning subject:
1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name (kebab-case)
2. Add basic structure files (concepts, dependencies, resources)
3. Update this README with the new subject information
4. Configure AI agents to recognize the new subject area
